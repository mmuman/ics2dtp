## Installation

### Debian

It is recommended to use the packaged version of Scribus, not a Snap.

(maybe sudo)
apt install libreoffice-script-provider-python python3-icalendar python3-recurring-ical-events python3-urllib3 python3-iniparse python3-markdown

If python3-recurring-ical-events is not found in APT, you'll need to install python3-pip, and then:
pip install recurring-ical-events
